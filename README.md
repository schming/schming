- 👋 Hi, I’m @schming
- 👀 I’m interested in motorcycles and mountain bikes. I would like to work of projects that can relate to those interests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS and MongoDB. I have previously used C# and ASP.net, but it has been a long time since then.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building the backend of an app related to the motorcycle industry! Frontend development is not my thing.
